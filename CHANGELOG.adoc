* RPC client API, http://msgilligan.github.io/bitcoinj-addons/apidoc/com/msgilligan/bitcoinj/rpc/BitcoinClient.html[BitcoinClient] is now using bitcoinj types for almost all JSON-RPC parameters and return types. See https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons/issues/9[Issue #9] to track progress.
* RPC client API, `setGenerate()` (also `generateBlock()`, `generateBlocks()`) when talking to `bitcoind` 0.9.x or earlier will return an empty list rather than `null`. If server is `0.10.x` or later, will return a list of `Sha256Hash`.
