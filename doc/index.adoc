Welcome to the GitHub Project Pages for *ConsensusJ*.

== Project Documentation

The starting point for documentation on *ConsensusJ* is the https://github.com/ConsensusJ/consensusj/blob/master/README.adoc[README] file. It contains links to all other documentation.

The main purpose of the GitHub Project Pages is to host the http://consensusj.github.io/consensusj/apidoc/index.html[API Documentation].

There is also the beginnings of a <<addons-user-guide.adoc#,User's Guide>> and a <<manpage-cj-bitcoin-cli.adoc#,manpage for the cj-bitcoin-cli tool>>.
