Welcome to the Github Project Pages for *bitcoinj-addons*.

== Project Documentation

The starting point for documentation on *bitcoinj-addons* is the https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons/blob/master/README.adoc[README] file. It contains links to all other documentation.

The main purpose of the Github Project Pages is to host the link:apidoc/index.html[API Documentation].

There is also the beginnings of a link:addons-user-guide.html[User's Guide].
